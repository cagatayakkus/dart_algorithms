## Time Complexity Table

| Process| Time Complexity
| :---: | :---: |
| Append | O(1) |
| Prepend | O(1) |
| Insert | B.C. O(1) / W.C. O(n) |
| Delete | B.C. O(1) / W.C. O(n) |
| Get | B.C. O(1) / W.C. O(n) |
| Length | O(n) |

PS: B.C. is a reference for best case, W.C. is a reference for worst case.
